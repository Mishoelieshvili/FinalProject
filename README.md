<h1>Web API in C# (.NET 7) - README
This README provides an overview of the Web API application built in C# using .NET 7. It explains the purpose of the application, its structure, and how to work with it effectively.</h1>

<h1><br>Introduction<br></h1>
Provide a brief introduction to the project, explaining its purpose and main features. Mention that the application is a Web API built in C# using .NET 7. Highlight the key controllers, models, entities, enums, initializers, services, and helpers used in the application.

<h1><br>Installation<br></h1>
Explain how to install and set up the application. Include instructions for downloading the source code and any specific requirements, such as .NET 7 SDK or Visual Studio. Describe the steps to restore NuGet packages and build the solution.

<h1><br>Configuration<br></h1>
Describe the necessary configuration steps to get the application up and running. Include details about any required environment variables or app settings that need to be configured. Mention the appsettings.json file and any specific settings that need to be modified, such as database connection strings or API keys.

<h1><br>Usage<br></h1>
Provide instructions on how to interact with the Web API. Explain the purpose and usage of each controller (UserController and LoanController) and the available endpoints they expose. Describe the expected request formats (headers, query parameters, request bodies) and the corresponding response formats. Include examples of sample requests and responses to illustrate how to work with the API effectively.

Mention the models used in the application (LoanDTO, LoginDTO, UserRegisterDTO) and their respective fields or properties.

<h1><br>Authentication and Authorization<br></h1>
Explain the authentication and authorization mechanisms used in the Web API. Describe the supported authentication methods (e.g., JWT, OAuth), how to obtain and use access tokens, and any required headers or tokens to access protected endpoints. Provide examples or guidelines for implementing authentication and authorization in client applications.

<h1><br>Deployment<br></h1>
Provide guidelines on how to deploy the Web API to a production environment. Explain deployment options, such as hosting on platforms like Azure or AWS, containerization using Docker, or setting up a self-hosted server. Include any specific instructions or considerations for scaling, load balancing, and monitoring the application in a production environment.

<h1><br>Contributing and Development<br></h1>
If your application welcomes contributions from the community, explain how users can contribute to the project. Provide guidelines for submitting bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests. Mention the technology stack used in development, coding conventions, and how to set up a local development environment.

<h1><br>Support and Contact<br></h1>
Provide information on how users can seek support or contact the project maintainers. Include links to issue trackers, discussion forums, or any preferred channels for communication. Encourage users to reach out for assistance or to report any issues they encounter.

<h1><br>License<br></h1>
Specify the license under which the application is distributed. Clearly state the terms and conditions for using, modifying, and distributing the application's source code.

By following this structure and providing comprehensive information in each section, users will have a clear understanding of your C# Web API application, its purpose, and how to effectively work with it.
